# CipherUtils

A lightweight and intuitive web application for encoding and decoding strings in multiple formats. Hosted on GitHub Pages, this app allows users to seamlessly transform text with options like Base64, URL encoding/decoding, and ROT13.

## Features

- **Encode and Decode Operations**: Choose between encoding or decoding your input text.
- **Supported Formats**:
  - Base64
  - URL Encoding/Decoding
  - ROT13 Cipher
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Input and Output areas for easy text transformation.
  - Dropdown menu to select the desired encoding/decoding method.
  - Buttons to execute encoding or decoding operations.

## How It Works

1. Enter your text in the **Input Textarea**.
2. Select an operation from the dropdown menu:
   - Base64 Encoding/Decoding
   - URL Encoding/Decoding
   - ROT13 Cipher
3. Click either:
   - **Encode**: To encode the input text.
   - **Decode**: To decode the input text.
4. View the result in the **Output Textarea**.

Create a PR with all the needed Encoding/Decodings that are not already in there, if you want to :)
